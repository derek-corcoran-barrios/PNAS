  abstract = "The prototype JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is an
              enveloped, RNA-containing coronavirus that has been selected in
              vivo for extreme neurovirulence. This virus encodes spike (S)
              glycoproteins that are extraordinarily effective mediators of
              intercellular membrane fusion, unique in their ability to
              initiate fusion even without prior interaction with the primary
              MHV receptor, a murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell
              adhesion molecule (CEACAM). In considering the possible role of
              this hyperactive membrane fusion activity in neurovirulence, we
              discovered that the growth of JHM in tissue culture selected for
              variants that had lost murine CEACAM-independent fusion activity.
              Among the collection of variants, mutations were identified in
              regions encoding both the receptor-binding (S1) and
              fusion-inducing (S2) subunits of the spike protein. Each mutation
              was separately introduced into cDNA encoding the prototype JHM
              spike, and the set of cDNAs was expressed using vaccinia virus
              vectors. The variant spikes were similar to that of JHM in their
              assembly into oligomers, their proteolysis into S1 and S2
              cleavage products, their transport to cell surfaces, and their
              affinity for a soluble form of murine CEACAM. However, these
              tissue culture-adapted spikes were significantly stabilized as
              S1-S2 heteromers, and their entirely CEACAM-dependent fusion
              activity was delayed or reduced relative to prototype JHM spikes.
              The mutations that we have identified therefore point to regions
              of the S protein that specifically regulate the membrane fusion
              reaction. We suggest that cultured cells, unlike certain in vivo
              environments, select for S proteins with delayed,
              CEACAM-dependent fusion activities that may increase the
              likelihood of virus internalization prior to the irreversible

               perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather
               than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise
               additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general
               gradient descent ``boosting'' paradigm is developed for additive
               expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms
               are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and
               Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic
               likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived
               for the particular case where the individual additive components
               are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such
               ``TreeBoost'' models are presented. Gradient boosting of

  author   = "Alizon, S and Hurford, A and Mideo, N and Van Baalen, M",
  abstract = "It has been more than two decades since the formulation of the
              so-called 'trade-off' hypothesis as an alternative to the then
              commonly accepted idea that parasites should always evolve
              towards avirulence (the 'avirulence hypothesis'). The trade-off
              hypothesis states that virulence is an unavoidable consequence of
              parasite transmission; however, since the 1990s, this hypothesis
              has been increasingly challenged. We discuss the history of the
              study of virulence evolution and the development of theories
              towards the trade-off hypothesis in order to illustrate the
              context of the debate. We investigate the arguments raised
              against the trade-off hypothesis and argue that trade-offs exist,
              but may not be of the simple form that is usually assumed,
              involving other mechanisms (and life-history traits) than those
              originally considered. Many processes such as pathogen adaptation
              to within-host competition, interactions with the immune system
              and shifting transmission routes, will all be interrelated making
              sweeping evolutionary predictions harder to obtain. We argue that
              this is the heart of the current debate in the field and while
              species-specific models may be better predictive tools, the
              trade-off hypothesis and its basic extensions are necessary to

              more efficiently than did the S-D614 pseudovirus, especially in

              for clinical use blocked elastase-enhanced S-G614 pseudovirus
              infection. Moreover, 93\% (65/70) convalescent sera from patients
              with COVID-19 could neutralize both S-D614 and S-G614
              pseudoviruses with comparable efficiencies, but about 7\% (5/70)
              convalescent sera showed reduced neutralizing activity against

              outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics of
              coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In response, many European
              countries have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, such
              as the closure of schools and national lockdowns. Here we study
              the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries
              for the period from the start of the COVID-19 epidemics in
              February 2020 until 4 May 2020, when lockdowns started to be
              lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to
              estimate transmission that occurred several weeks previously,
              allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use
              partial pooling of information between countries, with both
              individual and shared effects on the time-varying reproduction
              number (Rt). Pooling allows for more information to be used,
              helps to overcome idiosyncrasies in the data and enables
              more-timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of
              some epidemiological parameters (such as the infection fatality
              rate), does not include importation or subnational variation and
              assumes that changes in Rt are an immediate response to
              interventions rather than gradual changes in behaviour. Amidst
              the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that are incomplete,
              show systematic biases in reporting and are subject to future
              consolidation. We estimate that-for all of the countries we
              consider here-current interventions have been sufficient to drive
              Rt below 1 (probability Rt < 1.0 is greater than 99\%) and
              achieve control of the epidemic. We estimate that across all 11
              countries combined, between 12 and 15 million individuals were
              infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4 May 2020, representing between
              3.2\% and 4.0\% of the population. Our results show that major
              non-pharmaceutical interventions-and lockdowns in particular-have
              had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued

              play a key role in controlling the entry into human cells and

              during its human to human transmission is largely unknown. In
              this study, we screened and analyzed roughly 3090 SARS-CoV-2
              isolates from GenBank database. The distribution of the four gene
              alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S
              genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2

              on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination
              event isn't detected among different alleles. However, purifying
              selection has conducted on the evolution of these genes. By
              analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using
              codon-substitution models (M8, M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio
              tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S
              glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure
              and a persistent D614G mutation is identified. The definitive
              positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by
              internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary
              Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy package. In addition,
              another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the
              signal sequence of the S protein is also identified. The allele
              containing D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion
              during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability
              of isolates with the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is
              relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at the
              subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit.
              Protein structural modeling shows that the D614G mutation may

              (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei
              Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed
              data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the
              epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS We collected
              information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and
              illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had
              been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics
              of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay
              distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we
              estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive
              number. RESULTS Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP,
              the median age was 59 years and 56\% were male. The majority of
              cases (55\%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to
              the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6\% of
              the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days
              (95\% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th
              percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages,
              the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial
              interval of 7.5 days (95\% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive
              number was estimated to be 2.2 (95\% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS
              On the basis of this information, there is evidence that
              human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts
              since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce
              transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar
              dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce
              transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

  abstract = "Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are similarly
              structured viruses with similar environmental survival, but
              different routes of transmission. While RSV is transmitted
              predominantly by direct and indirect contact, influenza is also
              transmitted by aerosol. The cold, dry conditions of temperate
              winters appear to encourage the transmission of both viruses, by
              increasing influenza virus survival in aerosols, and increasing
              influenza and RSV survival on surfaces. In contrast, the hot, wet
              conditions of tropical rainy seasons appear to discourage aerosol
              transmission of influenza, by reducing the amount of influenza
              virus that is aerosolized, and probably also by reducing
              influenza survival in aerosol. The wet conditions of tropical
              rainy seasons may, however, encourage contact transmission of
              both viruses, by increasing the amount of virus that is deposited
              on surfaces, and by increasing virus survival in droplets on
              surfaces. This evidence suggests that the increased incidence of

              small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of

              charged HA residues K145 and E227 in the 2009 HA binding pocket

              charged D225 provides a larger number of hydrogen-bonding

              disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has a wide range of disease
              manifestations, including relatively mild respiratory illness to
              severe disease requiring hospitalization. Patients with signs of
              COVID-19 (fever, coughing, shortness of breath) were tested for
              the virus by targeting specific SARS-COV-2 genomic loci via
              RT-PCR using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs.
              However, this testing does not yield genetic information required
              for identifying viral evolution or variants. METHODS: We
              sequenced 200 specimens from positively identified cases in
              Nevada through our robust protocol for sequencing SARS-CoV-2
              genomes directly from patients nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs. This
              protocol enabled identification of specific nucleotide variants
              including those for D614G and clade defining mutations.
              Additionally, these sequences were used to determine the
              phylogenetic relationships of SARS-CoV-2 genomes of public health
              importance occurring in the state of Nevada. RESULTS: Our study
              reports the finding of a novel variant in the nsp12 (RdRp-RNA
              dependent RNA Polymerase) protein at residue 323 (314aa of orf1b)
              to Phenylalanine (F) from Proline (P), present in the original

              very high frequency in Northern Nevada suggesting for a founder
              effect. Structural modeling of the RdRP with P323F mutation did

  abstract = "1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and
              prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to
              express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities
              and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to
              boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting
              statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional
              techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted
              regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms:
              regression trees (models that relate a response to their
              predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive
              method for combining many simple models to give improved
              predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as
              an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple
              trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted
              regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based
              methods, handling different types of predictor variables and
              accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data
              transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex
              nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction
              effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT
              overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their
              relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are
              complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful
              ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior
              to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of
              BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We
              demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT
              through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel
              (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New
              Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate
              effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model
              using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to
              enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.",

              concern. The virus binds to host cells through its trimeric spike

              protein by cryo--electron microscopy. Using biophysical assays,
              the authors show that this protein binds at least 10 times more
              tightly than the corresponding spike protein of severe acute
              respiratory syndrome (SARS)--CoV to their common host cell
              receptor. They also tested three antibodies known to bind to the
              SARS-CoV spike protein but did not detect binding to the
              2019-nCoV spike protein. These studies provide valuable
              information to guide the development of medical counter-measures

              of the 2019-nCoV spike (S) protein resembles that of SARS-CoV S,
              but 2019-nCoV S binds more tightly to the host receptor. The
              outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic
              threat that has been declared a public health emergency of
              international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key
              target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To
              facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a
              3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo--electron microscopy structure of
              the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The
              predominant state of the trimer has one of the three
              receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a
              receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and
              structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds
              angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than
              does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S.
              Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific
              monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable
              binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity
              may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S
              should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical
              countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.",

              viable virus from clinically generated aerosols. Methods - Air
              samples were collected in the room of two COVID-19 patients, one
              of whom had an active respiratory infection with a nasopharyngeal
              (NP) swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. By using VIVAS air
              samplers that operate on a gentle water-vapor condensation
              principle, material was collected from room air and subjected to

  abstract = "Using the guinea pig as a model host, we show that aerosol spread
              of influenza virus is dependent upon both ambient relative
              humidity and temperature. Twenty experiments performed at
              relative humidities from 20\% to 80\% and 5 degrees C, 20 degrees
              C, or 30 degrees C indicated that both cold and dry conditions
              favor transmission. The relationship between transmission via
              aerosols and relative humidity at 20 degrees C is similar to that
              previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses
              (except at high relative humidity, 80\%), implying that the
              effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus
              particle. For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 degrees C, the
              duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that
              of animals housed at 20 degrees C; this increased shedding likely
              accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 degrees C. To
              investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth,
              expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several
              innate immune mediators were determined. Innate responses proved
              to be comparable between animals housed at 5 degrees C and 20
              degrees C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 degrees C) does
              not impair the innate immune response in this system. Although
              the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the
              underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not
              clear. We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the
              role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and
              thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the
              understanding of influenza epidemiology and evolution.",

  abstract = "This study reviews recent experimental data from our own and
              other laboratories on the effects of hypertension on the arterial
              wall and the potential mechanisms by which hypertension can
              induce vascular injury and accelerate atherosclerosis. The
              findings suggest that the responses of the arterial media to
              hypertension reflect appropriate adaptations to increased
              intramural tension with resultant medial thickening secondary to
              an increase in both cellular mass and extracellular matrix. The
              role of growth factors in this process and their effects on
              arterial contractility are discussed as well as the potential
              importance of the changes in extracellular matrix constituents.
              The intimal changes induced by hypertension have many
              similarities to those caused by aging or hypercholesterolemia and
              can in part reflect general arterial responses to injury. They
              make the arterial wall more vulnerable to the effects of
              hypercholesterolemia, however, and as noted in our studies with
              the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit, pronounced
              acceleration of atherosclerosis is induced when hypertension is
              combined with hypercholesterolemia. Antihypertensive drugs can
              affect the arterial response to hypercholesterolemia. In the
              present study, new data are provided indicating that captopril
              inhibits aortic atherosclerosis in the Watanabe heritable
              hyperlipidemic rabbit in association with a pronounced reduction
              in cellularity of lesions.",
